      "So to recap - Abernathy is Jenkins' boss, Jenkins is your boss and he ordered you to off Abernathy. It's a classic damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. You kill her - you're fucked. You tell Abernathy - you're even more fucked. Why? Because for the past few years you've been batting for Jenkins' team. If you get the job done, and do it well, you might get a promotion, but forget sleeping at night, because who knows how soon you'll be in someone's crosshairs. Only proves the wide variety of opportunities Arasaka has to offer.",
